        My name is Rudra, and I am a passionate web developer with a focus on creating accessible, enjoyable, and feature-rich web applications. I believe in the power of small, consistent improvements to drive progress and success. Whether working with established technologies or exploring the cutting-edge, I am always eager to learn and innovate.
        <br />
        One of the things that sets me apart as a developer is my focus on accessibility. I believe that all web applications should be designed to be inclusive and usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. To achieve this goal, I follow industry best practices and strive to stay up-to-date with the latest accessibility standards and guidelines to ensure that my work is always compliant.
