      Hello! I'm Rudra, a highly motivated and enthusiastic computer science student on a mission to unravel the mysteries of technology. From a young age, I've been captivated by the immense power and potential of computers to reshape our world.
      <br/><br/>
      Driven by my curiosity and a love for problem-solving, I find great joy in deciphering complex algorithms, crafting elegant code, and developing innovative software solutions. Through my studies, I've gained a solid foundation in key computer science principles such as data structures, algorithms, operating systems, DBMS and fullstack dev.
      <br/><br/>
      But computer science is not just about theoretical knowledge. It's about putting ideas into action. That's why I actively seek opportunities to apply my skills and expand my horizons.
      <br/><br/>
      What truly excites me is the potential of technology to make a positive impact on society. I envision a future where technological innovations improve lives, enhance industries, and contribute to sustainable development. I believe that through creativity, collaboration, and a deep understanding of computer science, we can shape this future together.
